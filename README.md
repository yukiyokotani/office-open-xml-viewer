<summary><b>Why this project exists — a note from the author</b></summary>

<br>

OOXML's behavior is defined by a written specification (ECMA-376 / ISO-29500), and there is a clear answer to compare against: Word, Excel, and PowerPoint themselves. In principle, anyone with enough patience could have built a faithful viewer — the spec says what to implement, and the Office applications show whether you got it right.

In practice, it didn't happen. For more than a decade, no free, open-source library reached a rendering quality good enough for real use. There are a few commercial libraries with decent fidelity (and editing support), but their pricing makes them hard to adopt casually. I think the reason is simply cost: the specification is huge, and reading and implementing it faithfully takes far more effort than volunteers can afford.

Generative AI changed that. A viewer is an unusually good fit for AI-driven iterative development ("vibe coding"): there is a spec to read and a correct output to aim for, so the work comes down to interpreting the specification and refining the rendering until it matches. Limiting the scope to viewing also avoids the most serious risk an Office library can carry — corrupting a user's files.

So I'm building this library with AI coding agents, spec-first, and keeping it free to use. For some documents it already reproduces the desktop Office applications more faithfully than commercial libraries — and sometimes even the official Microsoft 365 web apps.

**[Live demo](https://ooxml.silurus.dev)**

A browser-based viewer for Office Open XML documents that renders to an HTML Canvas element.
The parsers are written in Rust and compiled to WebAssembly; the renderers use the Canvas 2D API.
Each format also exposes a headless engine (`DocxDocument` / `XlsxWorkbook` / `PptxPresentation`) that renders into any caller-supplied canvas, so you can compose your own UI — scroll views, thumbnail grids, master-detail panes — instead of being locked into the built-in viewer. See the `Examples` section in [the Storybook demo](https://ooxml.silurus.dev/storybook/).

| DOCX | XLSX | PPTX |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| ![docx](docs/images/docx.png) | ![xlsx](docs/images/xlsx.png) | ![pptx](docs/images/pptx.png) |

```bash
npm install @silurus/ooxml
# or
pnpm add @silurus/ooxml
```

> **Bundler note**: the Rust parsers ship as real `.wasm` asset files next to the
> JavaScript, referenced with the standard `new URL('…', import.meta.url)` form
> and fetched (streaming-compiled) at load time. Verified to work with zero
> config: **webpack 5**, **Next.js** (Turbopack, dev and build), **Vite 8**
> (dev and build), **Vite 7 production builds**, and a plain
> `<script type="module">` with no bundler at all. Two setups need a hand:
>
> - **Vite 7 dev server**: the dependency optimizer rewrites the asset reference
>   into its own cache path and the load fails (fixed in Vite 8). Add
>   `optimizeDeps: { exclude: ['@silurus/ooxml'] }` to your `vite.config` —
>   production builds are unaffected.
> - **esbuild / Angular CLI** (whose application builder is esbuild-based):
>   `new URL` asset references are not processed
>   ([esbuild#795](https://github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/795)). Copy the
>   `.wasm` into your served output and point the viewer at it with the
>   `wasmUrl` load option — see the [Angular example](#framework-examples) for
>   the two-step setup.
>
> `wasmUrl` also serves the parser WASM from a CDN or any path you control:
>
> ```typescript
> new DocxViewer(canvas, { wasmUrl: 'https://cdn.example.com/docx_parser_bg.wasm' });
> ```

> **Bundle size note**: the package is ESM-only (`.mjs`). npm's *Unpacked Size* sums every entry bundle **and** the standalone MathJax + STIX Two Math asset (`mathjax-stix2.js`, ~3 MB) that ships in the tarball, so the reported figure is much larger than any single app build. What actually lands in your app is smaller on two counts: import only the format you need (e.g. `@silurus/ooxml/pptx`), and the math engine is a **separate entry** (`@silurus/ooxml/math`). Its main-thread chunk is a ~1 KB loader that references the ~3 MB engine asset as a **sibling file** (not an inline data URL): the engine is fetched **lazily, only when a document actually contains equations** — and only if you imported `@silurus/ooxml/math` and passed it to a viewer in the first place (see [Rendering equations](#rendering-equations)). Never import the `math` entry and the loader chunk never enters your graph at all.

---

## Quick Start

```typescript
import { DocxViewer } from '@silurus/ooxml/docx';
import { XlsxViewer } from '@silurus/ooxml/xlsx';
import { PptxViewer } from '@silurus/ooxml/pptx';

// DOCX — caller provides the <canvas>
const canvas = document.getElementById('docx-canvas') as HTMLCanvasElement;
const docx = new DocxViewer(canvas);
await docx.load('/document.docx');
docx.nextPage();

// XLSX — viewer manages its own <canvas> + tab bar
const container = document.getElementById('xlsx-container') as HTMLElement;
const xlsx = new XlsxViewer(container);
await xlsx.load('/workbook.xlsx');

// PPTX — caller provides the <canvas>
const canvas = document.getElementById('pptx-canvas') as HTMLCanvasElement;
const pptx = new PptxViewer(canvas);
await pptx.load('/deck.pptx');
pptx.nextSlide();
```

### Rendering equations

OMML equations (`m:oMath` / `m:oMathPara`) in `.docx`, `.pptx` and `.xlsx` are rendered with
[MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) + [STIX Two Math](https://github.com/stipub/stixfonts).
That engine is ~3 MB, so it is **opt-in**: import the `math` engine from the separate
`@silurus/ooxml/math` entry and pass it to the viewer. Pass it and equations render;
omit it and the engine is referenced nowhere, so a bundler leaves it out of your build
entirely (equations are simply skipped). When you *do* pass it, the ~3 MB engine ships
as a **standalone asset file** next to the bundle rather than an inline data URL, and is
fetched **on demand — only the first time a document actually contains an equation**, so
equation-free documents never pay for it. It is fully self-contained: served from your own
origin, no cross-origin requests.

```typescript
import { DocxViewer } from '@silurus/ooxml/docx';
import { math } from '@silurus/ooxml/math';

const canvas = document.getElementById('docx-canvas') as HTMLCanvasElement;
const docx = new DocxViewer(canvas, { math }); // ← equations now render
await docx.load('/paper-with-equations.docx');
```

The same `math` engine works for every viewer (`DocxViewer`, `PptxViewer`,
`XlsxViewer`) and every headless engine (`DocxDocument`, `PptxPresentation`,
`XlsxWorkbook`). You inject it **once** where you create the object — the viewer
constructor or the `.load()` options — and every render reuses it; it is never a
per-render argument. (Excel stores "Insert > Equation" as OMML inside the shared
DrawingML `<xdr:txBody>` grammar, so `XlsxViewer` renders equations embedded in
shapes / text boxes the same way.)

### Off-main-thread rendering

By default the headless engines parse in a worker but render on the main thread.
Pass `mode: 'worker'` to `.load()` to parse **and** render entirely inside a Web
Worker — the main thread only paints the returned `ImageBitmap` via a
`bitmaprenderer` context, keeping it free for scrolling and input. It requires
`Worker` + `OffscreenCanvas`.

```typescript
import { PptxPresentation } from '@silurus/ooxml/pptx';

// Render entirely inside a Web Worker — the main thread only paints bitmaps.
const pres = await PptxPresentation.load('/deck.pptx', { mode: 'worker' });
const canvas = document.getElementById('pptx-canvas') as HTMLCanvasElement;
const bitmap = await pres.renderSlideToBitmap(0, { width: 960, dpr: window.devicePixelRatio });
const ctx = canvas.getContext('bitmaprenderer') as ImageBitmapRenderingContext;
ctx.transferFromImageBitmap(bitmap); // consumes the bitmap
```

The `*ToBitmap` method exists on all three engines —
`PptxPresentation.renderSlideToBitmap(slideIndex, opts)`,
`DocxDocument.renderPageToBitmap(pageIndex, opts)`, and
`XlsxWorkbook.renderViewportToBitmap(sheetIndex, viewport, opts)` (the xlsx
variant **requires** `opts.width` and `opts.height`, since a worker has no DOM
element to measure). They work in **both** modes — in main mode they render to
an internal `OffscreenCanvas` — so you can write mode-agnostic code.

Notes:

- The returned `ImageBitmap` is owned by the caller: `transferFromImageBitmap`
  consumes it, or call `bitmap.close()` when done.
- The canvas-target methods (`renderSlide(canvas)`, `renderPage(canvas)`,
  `renderViewport(canvas)`) are unavailable in worker mode — use the `*ToBitmap`
  variants instead.
- OMML equations require `mode: 'main'`; in worker mode they are skipped (with a
  console warning).
- Trade-off: worker mode keeps the main thread responsive, but each frame is
  transferred back as an `ImageBitmap`, so a single render can be marginally
  slower than `mode: 'main'`. Choose it for non-blocking UI, not raw speed.

### In-memory PPTX shape updates

In `mode: 'main'`, `PptxPresentation.applyShapeChanges()` atomically applies a
serializable batch of top-level deltas to one slide-owned shape. The single
`PptxShapeChangeType.Update` operation exposes every mutable `ShapeElement`
property without paths into the private presentation model. The DrawingML
`cNvPr@id` is slide-local and immutable.

```typescript
import { PptxShapeChangeType } from '@silurus/ooxml/pptx';

const result = pres.applyShapeChanges({
  slideIndex: 0,
  shapeId: '7',
  changes: [
    {
      type: PptxShapeChangeType.Update,
      patch: {
        x: 914400, // 1 inch in EMU
        fill: { fillType: 'solid', color: '4472C4' },
        // Nested values are complete replacements, not deep patches.
        textBody: updatedTextBody,
      },
    },
  ],
});

// Only the affected slide needs to be redrawn.
await pres.renderSlide(canvas, result.slideIndex, { width: 960 });

// The same serializable changes can be recorded or adapted to a server command.
JSON.stringify(result.applied);

// The inverse batch is already ordered for undo.
const undoResult = pres.applyShapeChanges({
  slideIndex: result.slideIndex,
  shapeId: result.shapeId,
  changes: result.inverse,
});
await pres.renderSlide(canvas, undoResult.slideIndex, { width: 960 });
```

The whole batch runs against an isolated draft. An invalid target, unsupported
value, or attempted `type` / `id` change rejects the batch without changing the
live model. Each `patch` is shallow: omitted top-level properties are preserved,
while supplied objects and arrays (including `textBody`) replace their previous
value in full. Use `unset` to remove an optional property. The returned
`applied`, `inverse`, and `shape` values are detached from the live model and
safe to retain in an undo/redo stack.

The method accepts ordinary shapes, text boxes/placeholders, connectors, and
file-authored SmartArt shapes that the parser represents as `ShapeElement` and
that carry an id. Pictures, tables, charts, and media use their own element
types; parser-synthesized SmartArt fallback shapes have no stable id and cannot
be targeted. Worker-mode mutation is not exposed because that mode owns its
parsed model inside the render worker.

### Continuous scroll viewers

`DocxScrollViewer` and `PptxScrollViewer` render the whole document as one
vertically-scrolling, PDF-reader-style surface instead of a single page/slide at
a time. Unlike `DocxViewer` / `PptxViewer` (which take a `<canvas>`), the scroll
viewers take a **container** `<div>` — they own the scroll host, virtualize the
page/slide list (only the visible window plus a small overscan is mounted), and
recycle canvases as you scroll.

```typescript
import { DocxScrollViewer } from '@silurus/ooxml/docx';

const container = document.getElementById('docx-scroll') as HTMLElement;
const viewer = new DocxScrollViewer(container);
await viewer.load('/document.docx');
// viewer.scrollToPage(3);
// viewer.pageCount, viewer.topVisiblePage
```

```typescript
import { PptxScrollViewer } from '@silurus/ooxml/pptx';

const container = document.getElementById('pptx-scroll') as HTMLElement;
const viewer = new PptxScrollViewer(container);
await viewer.load('/deck.pptx');
// viewer.scrollToSlide(2);
// viewer.slideCount, viewer.topVisibleSlide
```

The container must have a bounded height (e.g. `height: 100vh` or a flex child)
so the viewer can size its scroll host to it. Base zoom fits the first page/slide
width to the container width and re-fits on resize; a `0`-width container defers
layout until it has width. Call `destroy()` to tear down (a self-loaded engine is
destroyed with it; an injected one is not — see below).

**Desk appearance.** The viewer paints each page/slide on its own white canvas
with a soft drop shadow, over a transparent "desk". Style the desk and the sheet
gaps without any wrapper CSS:

```typescript
const viewer = new DocxScrollViewer(container, {
  background: '#f3f4f6',            // the desk behind / between pages
  gap: 24,                          // vertical gap between pages
  paddingTop: 32,                   // desk padding above the first page
  pageShadow: '0 0 0 1px #c8ccd0',  // crisp 1px "border" look (box-shadow never shifts layout)
  // pageShadow: false,             // flat pages, no shadow
});
```

`paddingBottom`, `paddingLeft` and `paddingRight` each default to `gap`, so the
sheet sits inside a uniform desk margin; pass `0` for a flush edge.

**Zoom.** `Ctrl`/`⌘` + mouse-wheel (and trackpad pinch) zooms the surface;
bare-wheel still scrolls natively. Zoom is flicker-free — a rapid gesture shows a
CSS preview and settles into a crisp re-render when it pauses. Bounds are the
absolute scale factors `zoomMin` / `zoomMax` (default `0.1` / `4`), and
`setScale(scale)` sets it programmatically. Pass `enableZoom: false` to disable.

**Text selection** (main mode only). Pass `enableTextSelection: true` to overlay
a transparent, selectable text layer per page/slide for native copy. In
`mode: 'worker'` the overlay stays empty (the per-run geometry cannot cross the
worker boundary) and the viewer logs one warning — use the default `mode: 'main'`
for selectable text.

**Hyperlinks.** For DOCX/PPTX the link hit regions live on the text-selection
overlay, so hyperlink interaction requires `enableTextSelection: true`; when that
overlay is enabled, links are interactive by default. XLSX hit-tests cells
directly, so links are interactive out of the box. An external link opens in a
new tab (scheme-sanitized to `http` / `https` / `mailto` / `tel`, `noopener`),
and an internal target navigates within the document (docx bookmark, pptx slide
jump, xlsx sheet). Pass `onHyperlinkClick(target)` to take over the click
yourself.
Pass `enableHyperlinks: false` to disable hyperlink interactivity entirely — no
hit-testing, no pointer cursor over links, no default navigation, and
`onHyperlinkClick` is never called; links still render as authored but are inert.
This applies to every viewer that supports hyperlinks (`DocxViewer`,
`DocxScrollViewer`, `PptxViewer`, `PptxScrollViewer`, `XlsxViewer`).

**Master–detail / shared engine.** Inject an already-loaded headless engine so a
paged viewer and a scroll viewer (or several panes) share **one** parse. When you
inject, `load()` is unsupported (the engine is already loaded), the engine's own
`mode` wins, and `destroy()` leaves the injected engine intact — the caller owns
its lifecycle:

```typescript
import { DocxDocument, DocxScrollViewer } from '@silurus/ooxml/docx';

const doc = await DocxDocument.load('/document.docx'); // parse once
const scroll = new DocxScrollViewer(container, { document: doc });
// ...also drive a thumbnail grid, a paged view, etc. from the same `doc`.
scroll.destroy(); // the injected `doc` is NOT destroyed — you own it
doc.destroy();    // release it yourself when every pane is gone
```

`PptxScrollViewer` takes the same shape with `{ presentation: pres }`
(`await PptxPresentation.load(...)`).

Both viewers also expose `relayout()` (force a re-fit when the container resizes
in a way a `ResizeObserver` cannot see — e.g. a late web-font load),
`onVisiblePageChange` / `onVisibleSlideChange` (fires when the top-most visible
page/slide changes), and `onError` (async per-page render failures are routed
here instead of crashing the scroll loop). The parse/render knobs from the
headless engines (`mode`, `useGoogleFonts`, `maxZipEntryBytes`, `math`, `dpr`)
are accepted too.

### Markdown export

Every headless engine can project its document to GitHub-flavoured markdown for
LLM ingestion, full-text search, or diffing — headings, lists, tables, and (for
docx) footnotes / comments are preserved; layout, fonts, and positioning are
dropped. The projection is compiled into the parser WASM you already ship, so it
adds **zero** bundle weight. `toMarkdown()` works in both `mode: 'main'` and
`mode: 'worker'` (it runs off the archive opened at `load()`):

```typescript
import { DocxDocument } from '@silurus/ooxml/docx';

const doc = await DocxDocument.load('/document.docx');
const md = await doc.toMarkdown();
```

`PptxPresentation.toMarkdown()` (title slides → `#` headings, body → nested
bullets, notes / comments collated) and `XlsxWorkbook.toMarkdown()` (each sheet →
a `## SheetName` pipe table) are the twins.

For a one-off conversion outside a viewer, the standalone
`@silurus/ooxml-markdown` package exposes the low-level functions and a CLI:

```typescript
import { docxToMarkdown, initDocxFromBytes } from '@silurus/ooxml-markdown';

initDocxFromBytes(wasmBytes);          // the docx parser's `_bg.wasm`
const md = docxToMarkdown(fileBytes);  // ArrayBuffer | Uint8Array | Buffer
```

```bash
npx ooxml-md document.docx            # → stdout
npx ooxml-md deck.pptx -o deck.md     # → file
```

All three formats follow the same shape: the worker parses the `.docx` / `.xlsx` / `.pptx` archive via WASM and posts a JSON model back to the main thread, where the renderer draws to the canvas. Rendering stays on the main thread so the canvas shares the document's `FontFaceSet` — an `OffscreenCanvas` in a worker has its own font registry and would silently fall back to a system font, producing subtly different text measurements (and wrap positions) from the installed theme webfonts. `@silurus/ooxml-core` holds the cross-format primitives that the three renderers all depend on: a unified chart renderer (bar / line / area / radar / waterfall), shape helpers (`resolveFill`, `applyStroke`, `buildCustomPath`, `hexToRgba`), the `autoResize` viewer utility, and the shared type definitions.

<summary><strong>Angular 19</strong></summary>

The Angular CLI's esbuild-based builder does not process the `new URL('…', import.meta.url)`
asset reference the parsers use ([angular-cli#22388](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/22388)),
so the `.wasm` never reaches the build output — and under `ng serve` the dependency
optimizer additionally rewrites the reference into its own cache path. **Both steps
below are required** (the asset copy alone fixes only production builds; `ng serve`
still 404s without `wasmUrl`):

```jsonc
// angular.json — copy the parser WASM into the served root
// (restart `ng serve` after editing this file)

  "build": {
    "options": {
      "assets": [

> **A note on text selection.** Across DOCX / PPTX / XLSX, text selection is currently implemented by rendering glyphs to the canvas while overlaying a transparent DOM layer that mirrors the canvas text positions for native browser selection. This dual-layer approach is a deliberate stop-gap: once the Canvas [`drawElement` API](https://chromestatus.com/feature/6051647656558592) (proposed in [WICG/html-in-canvas](https://github.com/WICG/html-in-canvas), currently in Chromium Origin Trial) ships across browsers, the project plans to migrate to a single DOM-as-source-of-truth pipeline where the canvas mirrors the DOM directly — eliminating the duplication while keeping z-order correctness and native selection / a11y.

## Companion packages

- **[`packages/markdown/`](packages/markdown/)** — `@silurus/ooxml-markdown` and the `ooxml-md` CLI convert `.pptx` / `.docx` / `.xlsx` to GitHub-flavoured markdown via the workspace WASM parsers. Same projection used by the MCP server (~21× smaller than the raw XML on the demo deck, ~8% bigger than a flat-text extractor). Includes a node20-based GitHub Action for bulk repo-wide conversion.
- **[`packages/node/`](packages/node/)** — Node-side parsers (`@silurus/ooxml-node`) exposing `parsePptx` / `parseDocx` / `parseXlsx` / `parseXlsxAllSheets` against the workspace WASM artifacts, with no DOM or Web Worker dependency. Useful for CI checks, headless rendering pipelines, and CLI tools. Includes an `ooxml-thumbnail` CLI (pptx-only first pass; requires `skia-canvas`).
- **[`packages/vscode-extension/`](packages/vscode-extension/)** — VS Code extension (`ooxml-viewer`) that registers `CustomEditorProvider`s for `.docx`, `.xlsx`, and `.pptx`, and (opt-in) auto-installs and registers the `ooxml-mcp-server` so AI coding agents in the same window (Copilot Agent mode, Claude, …) can read those files via dedicated tools. The preview is offline by default; an opt-in `ooxmlViewer.useGoogleFonts` setting (off, and force-disabled in untrusted workspaces) surfaces the library's metric-compatible font substitution, widening the webview CSP to the Google Fonts CDN only while enabled.
- **[`packages/mcp-server/`](packages/mcp-server/)** — Rust MCP server (`ooxml-mcp-server`) exposing the parsers as tools for AI agents (Claude, Copilot, Codex, etc.). Provides structured queries (`docx_get_structure`, `xlsx_get_cell_range`, `pptx_get_slide_structure`, …) so agents can inspect OOXML files without shelling out to `unzip`. Prebuilt binaries are attached to each [GitHub Release](https://github.com/yukiyokotani/office-open-xml-viewer/releases) for macOS / Linux / Windows; the VS Code extension downloads them on demand.

## Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Build all WASM parsers (requires Rust + wasm-pack)
pnpm build:wasm

# Start Storybook dev server (port 6006)
pnpm storybook

# Type-check all packages
pnpm typecheck

# Run visual regression tests (local only — not run in CI)
pnpm vrt
# Adopt the current rendering as the new reference baseline
UPDATE_REFS=1 pnpm vrt

# Build the library
pnpm build
```

### WASM build (individual packages)

```bash
cd packages/docx/parser && wasm-pack build --target web && cp pkg/docx_parser_bg.wasm  pkg/docx_parser.js  ../src/wasm/
cd packages/xlsx/parser && wasm-pack build --target web && cp pkg/xlsx_parser_bg.wasm  pkg/xlsx_parser.js  ../src/wasm/
cd packages/pptx/parser && wasm-pack build --target web && cp pkg/pptx_parser_bg.wasm pkg/pptx_parser.js ../src/wasm/
```

## Security & Privacy

- **Canvas-only rendering.** Documents are decoded and drawn to an `HTMLCanvasElement`. No script, link, form, or other active content from the source file is executed or injected into the DOM.
- **ZIP decompression cap.** Each entry in the source archive is limited to 512 MiB of uncompressed output by default to block zip-bomb DoS. Override per viewer with `maxZipEntryBytes` (bytes) — raise it for legitimate decks with large embedded media, lower it to tighten the budget for untrusted input:
  ```ts
  new PptxViewer(canvas, { maxZipEntryBytes: 64 * 1024 * 1024 }); // 64 MiB
  ```
  Supported uniformly by `DocxViewer`, `PptxViewer`, and `XlsxViewer`. Zero / negative values fall back to the default.
- **No network by default.** The library does not send telemetry or analytics, and does not contact third-party services unless you ask it to. In particular, theme webfonts, Office font metric substitutes (Carlito/Caladea), and the script fallback fonts are **not** loaded from Google Fonts unless you pass `useGoogleFonts: true` to the relevant `Viewer` / `load(...)` options — supported uniformly by `DocxViewer`, `PptxViewer`, and `XlsxViewer`. When enabled, fonts for non-Latin scripts are supplied on demand from Noto families so text does not fall back to tofu: Arabic (Noto Naskh/Sans Arabic), CJK (Noto Sans/Serif KR · SC · TC · JP, picked per document language so shared Han glyphs take the right shapes), Cyrillic (Noto Sans/Serif), Hebrew (Noto Sans/Serif Hebrew, RTL), Thai (Noto Sans Thai) and Devanagari (Noto Sans Devanagari). No font binaries ship in the bundle. Enabling this option causes the end-user's browser to send an HTTP request (IP and User-Agent) to `fonts.googleapis.com`, which may have GDPR implications for your application — consider self-hosting the required fonts via `@font-face` instead.
- **XML parsing.** Uses `roxmltree`, which does not resolve external entities (XXE-safe by default).
- **Encrypted OOXML ([MS-OFFCRYPTO] Agile Encryption).** Password-protected `.docx` / `.xlsx` / `.pptx` files are OLE2/CFB containers, not ZIPs. Pass `password` to `load(...)` and the file is decrypted **client-side** via WebCrypto — no bytes and no password leave the browser:
  ```ts
  const doc = await DocxDocument.load(bytes, { password: 'secret' });
  ```
  Key derivation (SHA-512 spin, commonly 100,000 iterations) and AES-CBC segment decryption run on the main thread and add roughly a second before parsing. Failures are typed [`OoxmlError`](packages/core/src/errors/ooxml-error.ts)s: no `password` on an encrypted file → `encrypted`, wrong `password` → `invalid-password`, a non-Agile scheme (legacy **Standard** / **Extensible** encryption, or an encrypted legacy binary `.doc`/`.xls`/`.ppt`) → `unsupported-encryption`. **Note:** decryption recovers the plaintext but does **not** verify the file's HMAC data-integrity tag ([MS-OFFCRYPTO] §2.3.4.14), so tampering with the ciphertext is not detected — treat decrypted output from untrusted sources with the same care as any other input.

## Third-Party Notices

The library's own code is MIT-licensed. It also bundles a small set of
permissively-licensed third-party components — see
[THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md](./THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md) (included in the npm
tarball) for the full list and license texts. Highlights:

- **[MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) + STIX Two Math**
  (Apache License 2.0) — the equation-rendering engine behind the
  opt-in `@silurus/ooxml/math` entry described in
  [Rendering equations](#rendering-equations). It ships in the tarball as
  a standalone ~3 MB asset but is never loaded by a consuming app unless
  that app imports `@silurus/ooxml/math` and the viewer is handed a
  document that actually contains an equation.
- **Rust crate dependencies** of the WASM parsers (docx/pptx/xlsx) — all
  MIT / Apache-2.0 (or compatible permissive licenses), no copyleft.

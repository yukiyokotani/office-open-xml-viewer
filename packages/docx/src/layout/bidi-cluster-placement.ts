/** WORD_CONDENSED_SPACING_ADVANCE_FLOOR splits a segment's paint at floored
 * clusters, and Canvas resolves bidirectional order only inside one
 * `fillText`. Place the split operations as the single operation they replace
 * would have been drawn: UAX#9 levels of the painted text in the paint
 * direction (Canvas applies no higher-level overrides), then each L2 reversal
 * (highest level first, down to the lowest odd level) mirrors its contiguous
 * run of operations within the run's own span. Operations are level-uniform
 * (split at level changes). A floored cluster drawn alone at an odd level
 * keeps its glyph's trailing edge on the right-to-left pen, its drawn
 * advance behind it. Work is linear per level. */

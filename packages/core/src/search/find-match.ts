/**
 * IX2 public find-result shape, shared by all three viewers.
 *
 * `findText` returns an ordered list of {@link FindMatch}. Every match carries
 * its ordinal position (`matchIndex`, 0-based, document order — the same index
 * `findNext` / `findPrev` cycle through), the matched `text`, and a
 * format-specific `location`. The location is where the three formats
 * legitimately differ — a docx match lives on a page, a pptx match on a slide,
 * an xlsx match in a sheet cell — so `FindMatch` is generic over it rather than
 * forcing an artificial common shape. Each viewer instantiates it with its own
 * location type:
 *
 *   - `DocxViewer.findText` → `FindMatch<DocxMatchLocation>`  ({ page })
 *   - `PptxViewer.findText` → `FindMatch<PptxMatchLocation>`  ({ slide })
 *   - `XlsxViewer.findText` → `FindMatch<XlsxMatchLocation>`  ({ sheet, ref, … })
 *
 * The generic default is `unknown` so `FindMatch` can be referenced without a
 * type argument (e.g. in generic UI code) while each viewer's return type stays
 * precise.
